# Epileptic-seizure-prediction-using-EEG-signals
This project focuses on predicting epileptic seizures using Electroencephalography (EEG) data. By leveraging advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning models, the system analyzes EEG signals to identify patterns associated with seizure events, aiming to provide early warnings and improve patient care.
