Overview

Epilepsy affects millions of individuals worldwide, with seizures occurring unpredictably. This project demonstrates a pipeline for EEG signal analysis and seizure prediction, aiming to:

Enhance signal clarity through preprocessing techniques.

Extract meaningful features from EEG data for analysis.

Train machine learning models to predict seizure events accurately.

Provide visual insights into EEG patterns and model performance.
